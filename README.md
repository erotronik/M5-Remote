# Project M5 REMOTE

Please note that this is a modification of the OSSM-M5-Remote project, which is available at https://github.com/ortlof/OSSM-M5-Remote.

This modification adds RGB LED Rotary encoders, and allows the installation of an LED in the push-button.

Furthermore, communication with the board is switched to I2C, using a PWM controller for the LEDs and a port expander for the Rotary encoders.

The modified PCB besign can be found in the `Hardware/PCB/kicad` folder.

## Overview of the OSSM-M5-Remote

A Remote Control Platform for all ESP Controlled Sex Toys, with a focus on the [OSSM](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware) and related toys.

![Final Addon](image/remote.png?raw=true "Remote" )

Intially developed for the OSSM Project: 
https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware
 

To help with development and design join the KinkyMakers Discord: https://discord.gg/MmpT9xE . Be sure to say hello in the #m5-remote channel. 

Works not with Official OSSM Firmware Right now.
This Branch is needed: https://github.com/ortlof/OSSM-Stroke

Supported in this version of the M5 remote:
## Supported sex toys in this version

| EJECT | https://github.com/ortlof/EJECT-cum-tube-project | [A Work in Progress]



# Build the OSSM M5 Remote Yourself

## Bill Of Materials for sourcing Electrical Components

**!! IMPORTANT!:** Only the M5 Stack CORE2 works with the OSSM M5 Remote PCB !!

BOM is on Octopart for Easy Sourcing: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/rURYMuwB

PCB Files are located in the /OSSM-M5-Remote/Hardware/PCB folder if you want to make one yourself or use a different manufacturer other than PCBWay.

## 3D Printed Parts Needed:

| Quantity | Part | Information |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1x | Bottom.stl or Bottom_Adafruit_LIPO.stl or Bottom-Magnets.stl| There is a specific version for the wider Adafruit LIPO battery. Print with the base side facing down, 6 walls 20% Infill | 
| 1x | TOP-*-Keycap-Standoff.stl | Top Depends on your Keycap: Cherry or DSA (DSA is wider) | 
| 4x | M5_Remote_Knob_Customizable.scad | If you go for the 3d Printed knobs |

Filament - A good quality PLA works well. While there are no threads it is recommended that your printer is well calibrated.  

__Note:__
If you are one of the very small number of Version 1 PCB users, you will need to change your version to V1 in the config.h. The current version in GitHub is V2.

# [Assembly instructions](Assembly.md)

## Operation, or...how do I use it?

1. Power on the OSSM and let it home.
2. Power on the OSSM M5 Remote.
3. Press the left encoder to select 'Connect'
4. It will connect to the OSSM and it will perform another home operation.
5. You can verify it is connected by looking in the top left corner, it should say 'connected'.
6. You can now begin use. You'll need to set the speed, depth and stroke to more than 0 and press the middle key to start. Start the speed out slow.
